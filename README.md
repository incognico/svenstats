# `svenstats.pl`
Log parser for Sven Co-op dedicated servers (SvenDS) logs, to gather player statistics (name, score, deaths, country, etc.).

## Notes
* Assumes default SvenDS log settings (`sv_log_daily 1`, `sv_log_onefile 0`)
* `sv_log_player_frequency` should be consistent for every log file to calculate playtime from the 'datapoints' value
* Score differences achived by players before a map ends may be lost for up to a maximum of the `sv_log_player_frequency` value (seconds). This is due to the nature of how the logging works and thus the gathered stats are not 100% accurate, but still good enough :)
* 'joins' are not acual joins, merely a hack to get a better session id ('idx')

## Requirements
* SvenDS log files
* Perl >=5.16
  * MaxMind::DB::Reader (and [GeoLite2-City.mmdb](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/))
  * MaxMind::DB::Reader::XS (optional but much faster, requires [libmaxminddb](http://maxmind.github.io/libmaxminddb/))
  * DBI
  * DBD::SQLite
  * File::Slurp
  * File::Basename
* SQLite 3
* xz-utils

## Get started
1. `sqlite3 scstats.db < schema.sqlite`
2. Configure `$db` and `$geo` in `svenstats.pl`
3. Optional: Feed it once with all existing (closed) logs (so not the one svends currently logging to!) `for i in /path/to/logs/excluding/the/current/one/*.log ; do svenstats.pl $i ; done` - Be sure to feed them in the correct order, from oldest to newest (\* glob in bash should take care)
4. Add a daily cronjob which feeds yesterdays closed log to `svenstats.pl` (example file: `svenstats_cronjob.bash`)
5. Do cool stuff with the gathered data

# `svenstats_oneshot.pl`
For posting daily statistics to Discord via webhook.
Same principle as `svenstats.pl` but without a database and thus only for one log file at a time.

## Requirements
* SvenDS log files
* Perl >=5.16
  * MaxMind::DB::Reader (and [GeoLite2-City.mmdb](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/))
  * MaxMind::DB::Reader::XS (optional but much faster, requires [libmaxminddb](http://maxmind.github.io/libmaxminddb/))
  * File::Slurp
  * File::Basename
  * LWP::UserAgent
  * Encode::Simple
  * JSON::MaybeXS
  * JSON::XS (optional)

## Get started
1. Configure the Discord webhook URL: `$url` in `svenstats_oneshot.pl` 
2. Optionally set `$steam` to `1` and set `$steamkey` to your Steam API key if you want to use the Steam API (adds links to the players Steam Community profile)
3. Add a daily cronjob which feeds yesterdays closed log to `svenstats_oneshot.pl` (example file: `svenstats_cronjob.bash`)

# `hldschat.pl`
Outputs the in-game chat logs in simple HTML format. Without a database and thus only for one log file at a time.

## Requirements
* HLDS log files
* Perl >=5.16
  * HTML::Entities
